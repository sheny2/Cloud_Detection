# STA 521: Project 2

This project is a case study of constructing cloud detection algorithms employed on satellite images. 

We split the data by blocks, employ a number of classfication methods and assess their performance by loss functions. 
The primary work of model fitting and cross validation (CV) is done via the `CVmaster` function. 
For any future users who want to reproduce our analysis or train classification methods based on new image data, please refer to the following. 

## Data Splitting 

Considering the non-independent nature of the image pixels, users should be careful when splitting the data for training and testing purposes. 
There are two non-trivial ways of data splitting used in this project. 

A. Horizontal Cut
The first method cuts each image horizontally in order to ensure that every resulting block has a reasonable portion of clouds and clear surfaces. Basically, each image is cut into five blocks by evenly dividing Y coordinates, and three of them would be used as training data, the rest two blocks are used as validation and testing respectively.

B. K-Means Clusters
The second method of blocked data splitting is to use the K-means algorithm. By selecting a cluster size of five, we can divide each imageâ€™s datapoints into five distinct groups (according to X-Y coordinates). Again, three of these are used for training data, one is for validation and the last one is for testing.

We recommend users to fit classification methods after both ways of data processing and verify that the CV results should be roughly similiar. 


## Usage of `CVmaster.R`:

The data used as input of the algorithm should be image pixels. For each pixel, it contains the following information:

-- Coordinates of the pixel: `Y-coord` and `X-coord`;

-- Expert labels of cloud or non-cloud: `Cloud` = `-1` or `1`;

-- Potential covaraites include `NDAI`, `logSD`, `CORR`, `DF`, `CF`, `BF`, `AF`, and `AN`.
