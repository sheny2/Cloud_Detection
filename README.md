# STA 521: Project 2 

This project is a case study of constructing cloud detection algorithms employed on satellite images. 

`CVmaster.R` Usage:

The data used as input of the algorithm should be image pixels. For each pixel, it contains the following information:

-- Coordinates of the pixel: `Y-coord` and `X-coord`;

-- Expert labels of cloud or non-cloud: `Cloud` = `-1` or `1`;

-- Potential covaraites include `NDAI`, `logSD`, `CORR`, `DF`, `CF`, `BF`, `AF`, and `AN`.
